      <p>As a part of my final for Tech Communications Editing we were to edit a set of instructions. The instructions were poorly written and in some places, dangerous.
      <br>
     I received a copy of instructions from a light studio kit. The instructions were poorly made, difficult to understand, and full of misinformation. The revisions were made with a general English speaking consumer as the audience. This editing project demonstrates my skills and knowledge of copyediting, proofreading, and comprehensively editing a document.  </p>
